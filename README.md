# eat-n-split

eat-n-split is a simple React application that allows you and your friends to split restaurant bills quickly and easily. You can add friend names (with an option to add a picture or use one of three defaults) and, by selecting a friend, open a window that shows the bill split details including:

- 💰 **Bill Value:** The total amount of the bill.
- 🧍‍♂️ **Your Expense:** How much you owe.
- 👯‍♂️ **Friend's Expense:** How much your friend owes.
- 🤑 **Payment Summary:** Who is paying the bill.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  
The page will reload if you make edits and you will see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.  
The build is minified and filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!  
If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them.
